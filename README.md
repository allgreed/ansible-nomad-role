# Ansible Role: Nomad
Quite opinionated Ansible role for bootstraping a single region, single datacenter Nomad cluster

## Role Variables

TBD

## Example Playbook

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: username.rolename, x: 42 }
